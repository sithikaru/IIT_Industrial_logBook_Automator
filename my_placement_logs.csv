- Updated MainActivity to Kotlin package structure
- Modernized Android build configuration

Dependencies:
- Updated pubspec.lock with latest package versions
- All Flutter plugins now resolved via SPM for iOS

This migration enables:
- Native Swift Package Manager support for iOS dependencies
- Faster dependency resolution and builds
- Better Xcode integration
- Elimination of CocoaPods overhead

Additionally, I configured the RevenueCat test store for in-app purchases and updated the application version.",Ensuring the package selection logic accurately reflected complex availability conditions and consistently presented potential issues to the user.,Refined the existing package selection logic to be more robust and implemented a warning system directly within the credits view to clearly communicate package availability.
2026-01-05 00:00:00,MONDAY,2026-01-11,1.1,"I managed dependencies by removing unused iOS plugins and updating the RevenueCat SDK. Additionally, I improved the user experience by adding a message for when no payment methods are available and optimizing a UI layout element.","A redundant `SizedBox` element was present in the UI layout for payment methods, leading to unnecessary complexity.","The redundant `SizedBox` was identified and removed, streamlining the UI layout and improving its efficiency."
2026-01-06 00:00:00,TUESDAY,2026-01-11,1.1,"I completed a significant refactor of the credits page, reimplementing its state management and integrating new payment gateway assets. Concurrently, I enhanced the application's overall robustness by centralizing error handling, adding API request timeouts, implementing mounted checks before state updates, and improving transaction fetching with comprehensive error management.","The application's API calls and critical data fetching operations, particularly for transactions, lacked sufficient error handling and robustness, which could lead to unhandled states, unresponsive requests, and an inconsistent user experience.","I addressed these issues by implementing request timeouts for all API calls, enhancing transaction fetching with robust error handling and improved state management, and centralizing error message handling with a new utility for consistent feedback."
2026-01-09 00:00:00,FRIDAY,2026-01-11,1.1,"I implemented a new Android-specific credits page integrated with RevenueCat and resolved critical UI and data handling issues on the existing credits page, including a stuck spinner and improved robustness against malformed product data.","A 'stuck spinner' was occurring on the 'Purchase Points' dropdown within the credits page, hindering UI reactivity.",I implemented a `ValueNotifier` for the 'Purchase Points' dropdown to ensure reactive UI updates and prevent the spinner from getting stuck.
2026-01-12 00:00:00,MONDAY,2026-01-18,1.1,"I implemented a limited credit trial flow, which involved streamlining the user interface by removing the dedicated credits page and tab, restoring credit balance displays and validation in key areas, and fixing the asynchronous purchase flow to ensure credits are consumed before quiz initiation.","The asynchronous purchase flow was not reliably consuming credits before the quiz started, potentially allowing users to begin quizzes without proper credit deduction.","The asynchronous purchase flow was fixed to explicitly consume credits before the quiz start event, ensuring proper validation and deduction."
2026-01-13 00:00:00,TUESDAY,2026-01-18,1.1,I updated the application's version number in `package.json` to reflect recent changes and prepare for an upcoming deployment.,"No specific technical challenge or bug was encountered during this task, as it was a routine version update.","Not applicable, as this was a standard procedural update rather than a problem-solving task."
